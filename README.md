# Lovelace animated weather card

This is a fork of https://github.com/bramkragten/weather-card. I modified the styles to better fit my dashboard, mainly making it use less vertical space. I strongly recommend to use the original one from [@bramkragten](https://github.com/bramkragten), unless you need exactly the same styles.

But if you are from Germany, check out my other project https://github.com/hg1337/homeassistant-dwd, it works perfectly with this weather card (the original one from [@bramkragten](https://github.com/bramkragten) and the modified one).
